# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Number of seconds to wait for a client message body before timing out. If

#
# This parameter controls two things in Yolk:
#   1. Whether or not Yolk.Static_Content.Static_Content_Cache_Setup is called
#      when starting a server using the Yolk.Server package.
#   2. Whether or not the static content URI dispatchers in Yolk.Handlers use
#      the Yolk.Static_Content.Compressable function for static content such
#      as CSS/HTML/JS files.
#
# If True and you do not use Yolk.Server to create and start your server, then
# you MUST call Yolk.Static_Content.Static_Content_Cache_Setup manually before

# AWS configuration option: No
#
# The directory where the .gz compressed versions of static content are saved.
# If you use the Yolk.Server package to create and start your server and the

# Natural
# Default: 86400
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# If a resource compressed by the Yolk.Static_Content.Compressable function is

Context_Lifetime 28800.0
# Duration

# Natural
# Default: 1
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# This is the minimum number of remaining free slots to enable keep-alive HTTP
# connections. For very busy HTTP servers, the Free_Slots_Keep_Alive_Limit should be
# about 1-10% of the Max_Connection parameter, depending on the duration of the average
# server response. The longer the average time to send back a response is, the higher
# Free_Slots_Keep_Alive_Limit should be.

Hotplug_Port 8888
# Positive
# Default: 8888

# Positive

# The maximum number of simultaneous connections to the server. This is effectively
# the amount of threads in the server.
#
# One thread is used for each connection, so a value of 5 basically means max 5
# concurrent requests.

Max_POST_Parameters 100
# Positive
# Default: 100
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# The maximum amount of POST parameters the server will accept from any one

# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Number of seconds before timing out when sending data.

Server_Host
# String
# Default: [no value]

#
# The name of the host machine. This can be used if a computer has more than one
# IP address. It is possible to have two servers at the same port on the same machine,
# both being bound to different IP addresses.
# If you set the Server_Host, remember that you can no longer access the server
# using http://localhost:Server_Port.
#
# Unless you _know_ you need to set the host, this parameter should be left empty.

# The name of the server.

Server_Port 4242
# Positive
# Default: 4242

# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# This is a regular expression which can be used to handle WebSockets
# originating from a specific domain. By default AWS handles WebSockets from
# any origin. If for example you only want to handle WebSocket connections from
# .fr domains you can use something like this:
#       .*.fr

WWW_Root static_content
# String
# Default: static_content
# Used by AWS:  Yes and No. This value is not used by AWS internally, but it is
#               part of the default AWS configuration system.
#
# Path to the directory where the static content files are located.
#
# NOTE:
#     Do _not_ add the final forward slash.

##################################
#      HTTPS - Secure Server     #
##################################

# These settings are only relevant if you're running a HTTPS enabled server.

Certificate certificates/aws.pem
# String
# Default: certificates/aws.pem
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Set the certificate file to be used with the secure servers.
# A single certificate or a certificate chain is supported. The certificates
# must be in PEM format and the chain must be sorted starting with the
# subject's certificate, followed by intermediate CA certificates if
# applicable and ending at the highest level (root) CA certificate. If the
# file contains only a singlecertificate, it can be followed by a private key.
# In this case the Key parameter (see below) must empty.

Certificate_Required False
# Boolean
# Default: False
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# If True the server must abort the connection if the client does not provide a
# valid certificate. If this option is True the Exchange_Certificate must also
# be True.

CRL_File
# String
# Default: [no value]
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# A filename containing a CRL (Certificate Revocation List).
# This makes it possible to control clients connecting to the server.

Exchange_Certificate False
# Boolean
# Default: False
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# If True then request the client to send its certificate to the server.

Key
# String
# Default: [no value]
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Set the RSA key file to be used with a secure server.

Security False
# Boolean
# Default: False
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Whether or not to accept HTTPS connections. If set to True, the server will
# accept HTTPS connections. If false, only regular HTTP connections are
# accepted.
# If set to True, AWS must've been compiled with SSL enabled, and the
# Certificate option must point to a valid certificate. A test certificate
# can be made like this:
#
#   $ openssl genrsa -rand <filename> -out ca-key.pem
#   $ $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
#   $ cat ca-key.pem ca-cert.pem > aws.pem
#
# The file aws.pem is now usable as a test certificate.

Security_Mode SSLv23
# String
# Default: SSLv23
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# The security mode to use for the secure connections. Available options are:
#
#   SSLv2,  SSLv23, SSLv3
#
# This parameter is obviously ignored if Security is False and/or AWS has been
# compiled without SSL support.

Trusted_CA
# String
# Default: [no value]
# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# This must point to the file containing the list of trusted Certificate
# Authorities. The CA in this file will be used to verify the client
# certificate validity.
