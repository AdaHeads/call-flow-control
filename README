    3. The Alice protocol

-------------------
--  Introduction --
-------------------

Alice converts LDAP queries to JSON, and JSON to LDAP queries, depending on
whether a client is reading from or writing to the LDAP server.

Alice is GPLv3, see COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME.

--------------------
--  Dependencies  --
--------------------

The Yolk demo application depends on one thing: Yolk.

If you managed to build and install Yolk, you will most certainly be able to
build and use the Yolk demo application.

Of course you should also adjust the configuration/ files to match your own
setup, but thats not really a dependency is it?  :o)

------------------------------
--  The database demo page  --
------------------------------

For the database demo page to work, you must set these my_config.ini keys:

    DB_Host
    DB_Name
    DB_Password
    DB_User

And obviously you must have a DB_Name database setup at the DB_Host with
credentials matching those given in DB_User and DB_Password.

You do _not_ need to create any tables in the DB_Name database.

---------------------------
--  The email demo page  --
---------------------------

For the email demo page to work, you must set these my_config.ini keys:

    SMTP_Host
    SMTP_Port

These must point to a reachable and functional SMTP server.

---------------------------------------
--  Using the Yolk demo application  --
---------------------------------------

After having build the Yolk demo application (see INSTALL), trying it out is
a simple matter of:

    Adjust the configuration/ files according to your setup
    $ cd exe/
    $ ./yolk_demo
    Using your browser, visit http://localhost:4242

You can stop the server cleanly pressing CTRL+c. Or simply kill the PID found
in the exe/yolk_demo.pid file.

Instead of starting/stopping the application by calling the yolk_demo executable
directly, you can use the tools/rc.yolk script. Using this will enable you to
run a Yolk application like any other server-software. It is properly detached
from the console. All you have to do is edit a few variables at the beginning of
the script, so it fits your environment.

To see the status page for the application, go to

    http://localhost:4242/status

and enter "admin" as username and "changemenow" as password. See config.ini for
how to change the password for this page. Look for the Admin_Password option.

-------------------------------------------
--  Using the Yolk demo as a foundation  --
-------------------------------------------

You can absolutely use the Yolk demo application as a foundation for your own
applications. Just do this:

    1. You probably want to rename the application from yolk_demo to something
       else. This requires you to:

         A.  Rename the main procedure in yolk_demo.adb.
         B.  Rename the main yolk_demo.adb file.
         C.  Adjust the project file accordingly, renaming the "for Main use" file.

    2. Adjust the My_Handlers package, and create matching view packages.

    3. Adjust the My_Configuration package and the my_config.ini file.

    4. Get rid of all the irrelevant Yolk demo application source code.

    5. Go!
