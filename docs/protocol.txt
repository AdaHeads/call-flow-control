Alice Protocol




Table of Contents






1 Introduction

Alice acts as the connector between one or more NAME_OF_PRODUCT 
clients and a data store/soft PBX that is comprised of a mixture 
of LDAP/PostgreSQL servers and one ore more FreeSWITCH servers. 
Her main task is to get and set data via a HTTP/JSON based 
protocol. This document is the final authority on the protocol 
understood by Alice.

2 The Protocol

In its most basic form the protocol consists of a set of “get” 
and “set” interfaces. You can either get some data from Alice, or 
you can tell her to set some data. 

When data is requested (get) the search parameters are always 
given as a HTTP GET query string and the result is always 
returned as a JSON string. When data is added/updated/deleted 
(set) the parameters are always given as a HTTP POST request and 
the confirmation returned from Alice will always be a JSON 
string.

In order to access any of the interfaces, a client must first 
authenticate itself. This is done using OpenID. The login 
interface is the only interface that can be accessed without 
prior login.

All data handled by the protocol is expected to be UTF-8 encoded. 
Alice does not check whether this is in fact the case, so when 
implementing clients, be sure to verify that all data sent to 
Alice is in fact UTF-8 encoded.

All interfaces should of course be prefixed with whatever 
server:port is used for a given Alice instance.

3 Getting Data

3.1 /get/company?o=[COMPANY]

This interface return all the data associated with COMPANY. If 
the given company doesn't exist in the database, then an empty 
JSON string ({}) is returned.

Only company data is returned when calling this interface. No 
employee data is returned. Calling for example

/get/company?o=Hansen%20VVS

could return a JSON string similar to this:

{

"o=Hansen VVS,dc=example,dc=com": 

    {

    "l": "Næstved",

    "o": "Hansen VVS",

    "street": "Slagelsevej 13",

    "objectClass":

        [

        "top",             

        "organization"

        ],         

    "telephoneNumber": "+45 5544 3321",

    "postalCode": "DK-4700"

    }

}

3.2 /get/person?o=[COMPANY]&cn=[PERSON]

This interface return the data associated with PERSON employed by 
COMPANY. Calling for example

/get/person?o=Hansen%20VVS&cn=Brian%20Hansen

could return a JSON string similar to this:

{     

"cn=Brian Hansen,o=HansenVVS,dc=example,dc=com": 

    {         

    "cn": "Brian Hansen",         

    "objectClass": 

        [             

        "person",             

        "organizationalPerson",             

        "top"         

        ],         

    "telephoneNumber": "+45 2266 1155",

    "sn": "Hansen",         

    "title": "Gasmester"     

    } 

}

3.3 /get/persons?o=[COMPANY]

This interface return the persons associated with COMPANY. 
Calling for example

/get/persons?o=Hansen%20VVS

could return a JSON string similar to this:

{     

"cn=Ole Johnsen,o=Hansen VVS,dc=example,dc=com": 

    {         

    "cn": "Ole Kappel Johnsen",         

    "objectClass": 

        [             

        "person",             

        "organizationalPerson",             

        "top"         

        ],         

    "telephoneNumber": "+45 55 11 66 35",         

    "sn": "Johnsen",         

    "title": "Svend"     

    },

"cn=Brian Hansen,o=Hansen VVS,dc=example,dc=com": 

    {         

    "cn": "Brian Hansen",         

    "objectClass": 

        [             

        "person",             

        "organizationalPerson",             

        "top"         

        ],         

    "telephoneNumber": "+45 2266 1155",         

    "sn": "Hansen",         

    "title": "Gasmester"     

    } 

}

3.4 /get/queue

This interface return the current call queue. This is updated 
once each second, so polling the /get/queue interface more often 
than once each second is both wasteful and pointless. Calling for 
example:

/get/queue

could return a JSON string like this:

{     

"normal": 

    [         

    {             

    "UTC_start_date": "2012-02-22 14:23:30",

    "id": "GDhcf2VBww",               

    "unix_timestamp": "1329920610",             

    "callee": "mU1Ff16h",             

    "caller": "d7sIp1kR"         

    }

    ],

"high": 

    [         

    {              

    "UTC_start_date": "2012-02-22 14:23:11",

    "id": "bRbYsMUVqx",             

    "unix_timestamp": "1329920591",                 

    "callee": "pMT3k2fb",             

    "caller": "oCgDF7ua"         

    }

    ],

"low": 

    [         

    {             

    "UTC_start_date": "2012-02-22 14:23:17",             "id": 
"VV8BFqGpqG",             

    "unix_timestamp": "1329920597",              

    "callee": "7ar4Y1qc",             "caller": 

    "ZQsRogwB"         

    }

    ]

}
