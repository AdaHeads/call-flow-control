Yolk_User thomas
# String
# Default: thomas
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# The system user that owns the Yolk application. When a Yolk application is
# started, this is the user it will run as.
# If the username given does not exist, or the system can't setuid to it, the

#           Logging             #
#################################

# There are two kinds of log data in a Yolk application:
#
#   AWS access and error log data
#   Application specific log data
#
# Both of these are logged to syslog, according to the facilities and levels
# set in this configuration file.
#
# Valid facilities are:
#
#      Kernel
#      User
#      Mail
#      Daemon
#      Auth
#      Sys_Log
#      Printer
#      News

#      Cron
#      Auth_Priv
#      FTP
#      NTP
#      Security
#      Console
#      Local[0-7]
#
# Valid levels are:
#
#      Emergency
#      Alert
#      Critical
#      Error
#      Warning
#      Notice
#      Info
#      Debug

AWS_Access_Log_Activate True
# Boolean
# Default: True
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# Whether or not Yolk start the AWS component with access logging turned on.
#
# All HTTP(S) traffic, successful and failed, is written to this log stream.
#
# Often a Yolk application will be running behind some sort of proxy, and this
# proxy might log all requests. In such a case, it is a waste of resources to
# also have AWS log all access requests. 

AWS_Access_Syslog_Facility_Level user:info
# String
# Default: user:info
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# Set the syslog facility and level for the AWS access log data. Use the

AWS_Error_Log_Activate True
# Boolean
# Default: True
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# Whether or not Yolk start the AWS component with error logging turned on.
# Errors logged to this stream relate to problems in the AWS component, such

Info_Log_Activate True
# Boolean
# Default: True

Info_Syslog_Facility_Level user:info
# String
# Default: user:info
# AWS configuration option: No

# This parameter only matters if Compress_Static_Content is True.
#
# NOTE:
#   Do not add the final forward slash.

Compressed_Max_Age 86400
# Natural
# Default: 86400
# AWS configuration option: No
#
# If a resource compressed by the Yolk.Static_Content.Compressable function is

# AWS configuration option: Yes
#
# Number of seconds before timing out when receiving data.

#
# Number of seconds before timing out when sending data.

Server_Host
# String

Server_Port 4242
# Positive
# Default: 4242
